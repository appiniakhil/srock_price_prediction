Stock Price Prediction using Long Short-Term Memory Model
=========================================================

Introduction
------------

This project aims to predict stock prices using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The data used in this project was obtained through web scraping. The code is written in Python and utilizes 100 days mean average and 200 days mean average to gather more information. The frontend of this project was built using Streamlit.

Data Collection
---------------

The data for this project was collected by web scraping various financial websites. Careful consideration was given to ensure that the data was reliable and up-to-date.

Data Preprocessing
------------------

Before the data could be used to train the LSTM model, it had to be preprocessed. This included cleaning the data and normalizing it.

Model Training
--------------

The LSTM model was trained using the preprocessed data. The model was trained to predict stock prices for a given company based on the previous 100 days and 200 days mean average.

Results
-------

The LSTM model was able to accurately predict stock prices for the given company. The results of the model can be viewed through the Streamlit frontend.

Conclusion
----------

This project successfully demonstrated the ability of the LSTM model to accurately predict stock prices using data obtained through web scraping. The Streamlit frontend provided an easy-to-use interface for viewing the results of the model.
